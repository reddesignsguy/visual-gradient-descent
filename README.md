Hi! This is an ML project that explores the inner-workings of core ML algorithms like logistic regression. Check out the ipynb file!

Concepts include:
- Perception Learning Algorithm
- Pocket Algorithm
- Polynomal Transformation
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Descent

The data is a subset of the MNIST dataset of only 1s and 5s.
